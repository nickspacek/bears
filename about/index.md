Ongoing Company Legacy
----------------------

For 32 years, Eugene O’Neill used his knowledge and expertise about nature to
establish Springbrook Camp Outfitters into the thrill of the hunt experience
that hunters seek. Over the past few years he has been passing that knowledge
on to previous guide and new owner Tom Mersereau.

Born and raised in Tracy, New Brunswick, Tom is familiar with the area in and
around including the wildlife and vegetation; tracks and trails; paths and paw
prints, alike.
